  I love including these comments in pages. It pleases me that
  you're reading them as well. It's like we're having a moment.
  We are. Anyway, the CreativeJS team though Fireworks would
  be teh r0xx0rz and I volunteered to give this a shot. So
  I hope you're enjoying them and doing the "Aaah! Oooh!"
  thing. If not I'm a bit upset, but I'll let it slide.

  Also, big shoutz to Paul Irish for the rAF shimidimmydoo.
